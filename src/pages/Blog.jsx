                    Q1. What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?

                        An access token is a credential used to access protected resources on a server, obtained after successful authentication and authorization. It is sent with each request to authenticate and authorize the user or client application. A refresh token is a credential with a longer lifespan that is used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires. It allows the client to request a new access token without reauthentication.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        On the client-side, access tokens are typically stored in memory or short-lived storage like browser session storage, while refresh tokens are stored securely in more persistent storage such as HTTP-only cookies, local storage, or secure storage provided by the operating system. Secure storage mechanisms are important to protect the tokens from unauthorized access. It&apos;s essential to follow the security guidelines and best practices of the specific technology being used to ensure proper storage and protection of access and refresh tokens.

                    Q.2 Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?

                        SQL and NoSQL databases are two contrasting types of database management systems. SQL databases adhere to a predefined schema and use SQL as the query language. They provide strong consistency, transactional support, and are well-suited for applications requiring complex querying. On the other hand, NoSQL databases offer a flexible schema, enabling the storage of unstructured or evolving data. They prioritize scalability and horizontal expansion, making them suitable for handling large amounts of data and accommodating changing requirements. NoSQL databases often have their own query languages and provide eventual consistency. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on factors such as data structure, scalability needs, and consistency requirements specific to the application at hand.

                    <p>
                        Express.js is a minimalist and flexible web application framework for Node.js, focusing on simplicity and customization. Nest.js, built on top of Express.js, is a structured and opinionated framework that brings modularity and scalability to Node.js applications using TypeScript. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs and preferences of a project, with Express.js providing simplicity and flexibility, and Nest.js offering a more structured and scalable approach to application development.

                    <p>
                        The MongoDB aggregation framework is a feature that allows for advanced data processing and analysis within the database. It works by applying a series of stages to a collection of documents, allowing for complex operations such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and transforming the data. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data and passes the transformed result to the next stage in the pipeline. By combining these stages and utilizing various operators and functions, users can perform sophisticated data analysis and obtain the desired output. The aggregation framework provides a flexible and efficient way to process data directly within MongoDB, enabling powerful querying and data manipulation capabilities.
